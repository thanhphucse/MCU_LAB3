SPECIFICATIONS OF PROJECT

You are required to build an application of a traffic light in a cross road which includes some features as 
described below:

    • The application has 12 LEDs including 4 red LEDs, 4 amber LEDs, 4 green LEDs.
    
    • The application has 4 seven segment LEDs to display time with 2 for each road. The 2 seven segment LEDs
    will show time for each color LED corresponding to each road
    
    • The application has three buttons which are used
    
        - to select modes,
        
        - to modify the time for each color led on the fly, and
        
        - to set the chosen value.

    • The application has at least 4 modes which is controlled by the first button. Mode 1 is a normal mode, 
    while modes 2 3 4 are modification modes. You can press the first button to change the mode. Modes will 
    
    change from 1 to 4 and back to 1 again.
    
        Mode 1 - Normal mode: The traffic light application is running normally
        
        Mode 2 - Modify time duration for the red LEDs: This mode allows you to change the time duration of 
        the red LED in the main road. The expected behaviours of this mode include:
        
            - All single red LEDs are blinking in 2 Hz.
            
            - Use two seven-segment LEDs to display the value.
            
            - Use the other two seven-segment LEDs to display the mode.
            
            - The second button is used to increase the time duration value for the red LEDs.
            
            - The value of time duration is in a range of 1 - 99.
            
            - The third button is used to set the value.
        
        Mode 3 - Modify time duration for the amber LEDs: Similar for the red LEDs described above with the 
        amber LEDs.
        
        Mode 4 - Modify time duration for the green LEDs: Similar for the red LEDs described above with the
        green LEDs.
